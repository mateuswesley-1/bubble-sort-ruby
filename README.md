# bubble-sort-ruby

Implement a bubble sort algorith in rubby 3.1.2.

# Teory
Every time we pass through the entire array, we are garatied to have the 
largest value in the end of the array. 
So if we have array.length = n, we just need n-1 interactions to sort the array, 
and in every interection we go until one position less than the former
